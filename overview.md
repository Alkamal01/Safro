Safro — AI-Powered Bitcoin Escrow & Trust Layer on ICP

Safro is a Bitcoin-first escrow platform built on the Internet Computer, designed for users who trade, buy, sell, or work across borders. It uses ICP’s native Bitcoin integration to create secure, instant, and trustless escrows — backed by an AI-driven trust engine that helps users avoid scams, analyze risk, and resolve disputes.

Safro combines:

Native BTC smart-contract escrows (no bridges, no wrapping)

AI risk scoring and trust analysis

Reputation and creditworthiness profiles

Cross-chain capability through ICP Chain Fusion

Fast transactions using ckBTC

Simple UI + optional USSD support for low-connectivity users

Problem

Millions of people in Africa and emerging markets buy goods, offer freelance services, or exchange currency through WhatsApp, Telegram, or Instagram. These deals lack trust and are prone to fraud because there’s no secure middle layer.

Current issues:

Trust-free marketplaces don’t exist for regular users

High scam rate in P2P trades and freelance payments

Cross-border transfers are slow and expensive

No simple, fair dispute system

No on-chain identity or reputation for everyday traders

Solution

Safro provides secure Bitcoin escrows that anyone can use.

How it works

Buyer creates a deal in Safro (Web/USSD).

Buyer deposits BTC or ckBTC into the escrow canister.

Seller delivers goods or service.

Funds are released automatically once both parties confirm.

AI monitors patterns, scores risk, and provides dispute guidance.

All BTC logic happens natively on ICP, with no centralized custodians.

Why Safro Stands Out

Safro is the first platform to combine:

✔ Fast ckBTC payments
✔ AI-powered trust layer
✔ Cross-chain signing
✔ Reputation + credit scoring
✔ Accessible UI + optional USSD

It solves a real emerging-market problem using the best of Bitcoin and ICP.
